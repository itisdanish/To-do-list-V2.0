Build a to-do list web application. This application will allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks they want to complete.

Here are the features you can implement:

User authentication: Allow users to sign up and log in to the application.

Task management: Allow users to add tasks, edit tasks, and delete tasks. The tasks should be saved in a database.

Task completion: Allow users to mark tasks as complete and keep track of the number of completed tasks.

Task prioritization: Allow users to assign a priority level to each task (e.g. high, medium, low) and display the tasks in order of priority.

Task due dates: Allow users to set a due date for each task and display the tasks that are due soon.

Task categorization: Allow users to categorize tasks into different categories (e.g. work, personal, shopping) and display the tasks for each category.

User interface: Create a clean and user-friendly interface for the application.

Mobile responsiveness: Make sure the application is responsive and works well on mobile devices.

To build this project, you'll need to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a database (such as MongoDB or Firebase). You may also want to use a front-end framework like React or Angular and a back-end framework like Node.js or Django.
